***Face Detection Controlled Servo Motor***

This project uses face detection to control a servo motor via an Arduino. The servo motor rotates to 90 degrees when a face is detected and returns to 0 degrees when no face is detected. The system combines Python (using OpenCV for face detection) and Arduino for servo control via serial communication.

**Features**
Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV.
Servo Motor Control: Rotates the motor to a specific position when a face is detected.
Arduino Integration: Facilitates communication between Python and Arduino using serial communication.

**Requirements**
Components Required
Hardware:

Arduino (e.g., Uno, Nano)
Servo motor (e.g., SG90 or similar)
Jumper wires
USB cable for Arduino
Software:

Python 3.x
Arduino IDE
OpenCV library
PySerial library

Installation Instructions
**1. Setup Arduino**
Connect the servo motor to the Arduino:
Signal: Connect to pin 9.
Power: Connect to 5V.
Ground: Connect to GND.
Upload the Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.
code file **arduino.txt**

**2. Install Python Libraries**
Install the required Python libraries:

*pip install opencv-python pyserial* or 
*pip install -r requirements.txt*

3. Connect Hardware
Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
Ensure the correct COM port is selected in the Python script and Arduino IDE.

**4. Run the Python Script**
*Place your face in front of the webcam. The servo motor will rotate to 90 degrees.*
*Remove your face from the webcam. The servo motor will return to 0 degrees.*
